# Bedrock-Chunk-Borders-Pack
 
This is a simple chunk pack for minecraft bedrock edtion. To use it, attach it as a typical resource pack to either global or world resources. To view the chunk borders, go into 3rd person and put a rocket or a nautilus shell in your off-hand; this will enable the chunk visibility, and subsequently disable it if either of these two items are not in your off-hand. and to use in first person name a dog "chunky" and it will follow you around and show you chunk borders in first person.
